# LuauSharp
This is the LuauSharp git repo, there is two versions of LuauSharp.
- [LuauSharp HighLevel](https://github.com/kinexdev/LuauSharp/blob/main/HighLevel.md) - An easy to use C# idiomatic api built for developer convenience when embedding luau.
- [LuauSharp LowLevel](https://github.com/kinexdev/LuauSharp/blob/main/LowLevel.md) - A thin wrapper over the C api, built with speed in mind.

I've used LuauSharp in some of my engines and games, this for example is my project for embedding luau into unity
